### Research question 

**You should phrase your research question in a way that matches up with the scope of inference your dataset allows for.**

How have the values of people from the United States changed over time with regard to science and technology and its positive/negative impact on the world.

  | Variables | Description
--|-----------|------------
005_203| E234 | The world is better off, or worse off, because of science and technology
010_023| S020 | Year survey
010_028| S024 | Country wave
010_004| S003 | Country/region
014_003| X003 | Age
014_030| X025 |	Highest educational level attained


### Cases 

**What are the cases, and how many are there?**



### Data collection 

**Describe the method of data collection.**



### Type of study 

**What type of study is this (observational/experiment)?**



### Data Source 

**If you collected the data, state self-collected. If not, provide a citation/link.**




### Response 

**What is the response variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorical)?**



### Explanatory 

**What is the explanatory variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorival)?**



### Relevant summary statistics 

**Provide summary statistics relevant to your research question. For example, if youâ€™re comparing means across groups provide means, SDs, sample sizes of each group. This step requires the use of R, hence a code chunk is provided below. Insert more code chunks as needed.**
