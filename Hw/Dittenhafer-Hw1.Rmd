### 1.8 Smoking habits of UK residents

#### (a) What does each row of the data matrix represent?

Each row of the data matrix represents a sample.

#### (b) How many participants were included in the survey?

Assuming row 1961 is the last row of the data, then 1691 participants were included in the survey.

#### (c) Indicate whether each variable in the study is numerical or categorical.

* sex: Categorical
* age: Numerical, Discrete
* marital: Categorical
* grossIncome: Categorical, Ordinal
* smoke: Categorical
* amtWeekends: Numerical, Discrete
* amtWeekdays: Numerical, Discrete


### 1.10 Cheaters, scope of inference

#### (a) Identify the population of interest and the sample in this study.

The population is children between ages 5 and 15. The sample was 160 children within the age range.

#### (b) Comment on whether or not the results of the study can be generalized to the population, and whether the findings of the study can be used to establish a causal relationship.

The sample size is small compared to the assumed population (all children 5-15). Also, it isn't clear how the sample was selected. As such, I am skeptical that the results could or should be generalted to the population.

The study is described as an experiment, with the independent variable being the instruction to cheat (or lack of instruction), and dependent variable being the cheating outcome. Based on the information in the 1.5 exercise write-up, a causal relationship is not supported. Age appears to be a confounding variable, but age alone is unlikely to be the driver... rather the maturity of the child more likely drives the probability of cheating. Either way, I don't see how this study could be used to establish a causal relationship.


### 1.28 Reading the paper

#### (a) Risks: Smokers Found More Prone to Dementia

Based on the study, I take away the conclusion that smoking (implied to be tobacco) is correlated with dementia. This may be related to a chemical response from nicotine, but may not be. It could be driven instead by another chemical in the smoke, or some other factor common to smokers. The description of the study suggests an "experiment" structure, an individual would always be aware if they are smoking or not, therefore a blind control group would not be possible.

#### (b) The School Bully Is Sleepy

The statement "The study shows that sleep disorders lead to bullying in school children" is not justified. The conclusion I draw is that there is a correlation between sleep disorders and behavioral issues. There may be another factor which is driving both the sleep disorder and the behavioral issue. 

### 1.36 Exercise and mental health

#### (a) What type of study is this?

This is a randomized experiment.

#### (b) What are the treatment and control groups in this study?

The treatment group is the the group instructed to exercise twice a week. The control group is the group instructed not to exercise.

#### (c) Does this study make use of blocking? If so, what is the blocking variable?

Yes, this study makes use of blocking in respect to the age of the participants. (p24) 

#### (d) Does this study make use of blinding?

No, this study does not make use of blinding. The participants know if they are exercising or not.

#### (e) Comment on whether or not the results of the study can be used to establish a causal relationship between exercise and mental health?

Given the exeriment design, a causal relationship conclusion is possible. The study proposal does not indicate how big the sample size will be, therefore I am unable to conclude that the study could be generalized to the population at large. 

#### (f) Suppose you are given the task of determining if this proposed study should get funding. Would you have any reservations about the study proposal?

* A proposed sample size should be included in the study proposal. I would expect a funding request to have factored in the cost of obtaining the sample data.
* The length of and intensity of the exercise should be better defined, otherwise the treatment group may have widely different exercise treatments.


### 1.48 Stats scores (p66)

# Include ggplot2

myTheme <- theme(axis.ticks=element_blank(),  
                  panel.border = element_rect(color="gray", fill=NA),

### 1.50 Mix-and-match (p67)

#### (a)

The distribution is mostly symmetric, unimodal and matches the (2) boxplot.

#### (b)

The distribution is fairly evening distributed, and depending on scale could be multimodal. It matches the (3) boxplot.

#### (c)

The distribution is right skewed, unimodel and matches the (1) boxplot.

### 1.56 Mix-and-match (p69)

#### (a) 

Q1 - 25% - Below $350,000; 
Q2 - 50% - Below $450,000 (Median);
Q3 - 75% - Below $1,000,000;
Meaningful # of houses that cost more than $6,000,000.

* Distribution: Right skewed due to the "meaningful" number of houses that cost significantly more than $1,000,000.

* Median would best represent the typical observation due to the fact that most houses are in the $350K - $1M range. I would expect the mean to be higher than then median, and potentially higher than the third quartile depending on the cost of the houses in the upper quartile.

* As a result of potentially shifted mean, the variance and standard deviation could be inflated as well. As such, the IQR would be a better representation of the variability of the observations.

#### (b)

Q1 - 25% - Below $300,000; 
Q2 - 50% - Below $600,000 (Median);
Q3 - 75% - Below $900,000;
Very few houses that cost more than $1,200,000.

* Distribution: Fairly symmetric due to the reasonably similar portion of houses in each of the quartiles, though slightly right skewed due to the few houses costing more than $1.2M.

* Median seems to still be the best representation of the typical observation, though in this data mean would be close due to the distribution of the data.

* Again, IQR seems the better represenation of variability, though standard deviation would make a close estimate of variability due to the distribution of the data.


#### (c) Number of alcoholic drinks

Assuming # of drinks/week as follows:

Bottom 75% don't drink or drink minimally (0-2 drinks/week) because 18 - 20 year old is under legal age in USA.
Upper 25% drink (3-6 drinks/week)
Only a few excessively (> 6 drinks/week).

* Disbribution: Left skewed due to low # of drinks much of data (long left tail).

* Median would be best representation of typical # of drinks for typical student since most students are below drinking age and would be in the lower 2 quariles.

* Again, IQR seems the better represenation of variability because it wouldn't be influenced by the few excessive drinkers.

#### (d) Annual salaries

* Distribution: Left skewed due to the long left tail of lower salaries and only a few very high salaries on the right.

* Median would best represent the typical salary. Mean would be influenced by the very high salaries and would show a non-typical high average salary.

* Again, IQR is best for variability. Standard deviation would be influenced by the few high salaries.
