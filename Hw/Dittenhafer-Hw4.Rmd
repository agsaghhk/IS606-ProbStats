### 4.4  Heights of adults (p204)

*Researchers studyiing anthropometry collected body girth measurements and skeletal diameter measurements, as well as age, weight, height an gender, for 507 physically active individuals.*

#### a) What is the point estimate for the average height of active individuals? What about the median?

The mean would be the point estimate for the average height, which is 171.1. The median is 170.3.

#### b) What is the point estimate for the standard deviation of the heights of active individuals? What about the IQR?

Given the distribution is mostly normal, we can use the sample standard deviation as the point estimate for the population standard deviation (p173), SD=9.4. 

The IQR would be derived from the sample IQR of Q3 - Q1 = 177.8 - 163.8 = `r 177.8 - 163.8`.
