# IS606-ProbStats
Code developed as part of my graduate work in the CUNY Master of Science, Data Analytics program's Statistics and Probability course (IS606). 

A brief presentation on Z Scores and the Normal Distribution can be found at http://rpubs.com/dwdii/Zscores. The original R Markdown code behind the presentation is available in [this repo's MeetupPresentation](https://github.com/dwdii/IS606-ProbStats/tree/master/MeetupPresentation) subfolder.
